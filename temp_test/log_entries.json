Those metrics are intended to examine: Faithfulness, Context Relevancy, Context Recall, Answer Relevancy, Aspect Critiques. I'm more interested in actions outside the RAG-pipeline itself. What can be done to improve coordination between searcher expectation and system performance? What can be done to remedy system failures at searching-time?"
