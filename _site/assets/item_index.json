Search Systems Andi Search Metaphor Perplexity AI Phind You.com Draft edited September 20, 2023 10:11 PM (PDT) See [the initial post here](https://danielsgriffin.com/ppost/2023/09/07/planning-SearchRights.html). This hosts the provisional comparative evaluation of new web search systems with a focus on dimensions around integrating with users' curiosity-engagement, question-generation, response validation, search repair, search sharing, complaint and feedback, and other concerns at the core of my research. The new attention to search, sparked by widespread interest in OpenAI's ChatGPT, has pushed many to develop new ways to search. This evaluation is a look towards comparing different search systems, with a particular eye towards finding and shining some light on systems that are opening up search in new ways. I have a wide range of criteria by which to provide some marks and remarks on these systems. I'll need to narrow them down and gradually work through them. I'm not thinking about them as goals, requirements, or desired-specifications, and some even may contradict. For some of the criteria I will provide citations as reference or support. Some criteria are drawn from examples in previous search systems (including shuttered, speculative, and experimental systems). My goal here is not to simply do an accounting of searching today, but to get some sense of where we might want search to go. Initial Search Systems In this initial set of reviews, I‚Äôm focusing on these search engines, listed alphabetically: Andi Search (andisearch.com) Metaphor (metaphor.systems) Perplexity AI (perplexity.ai) Phind (phind.com) You.com (you.com) These are my initial examples of new approaches to searching in generative web search systems. I may provide come contextualizing comments about other systems, like the explicit search-focused tools from Google and Microsoft, and chat-based systems like ChatGPT, Anthropic‚Äôs Claude, etc., that support search and search-like interactions. To they extend that they support public-facing search, I will also be examining newer search libraries and services (including RAG frameworks), like the offerings from LangChain, from LlamaIndex, and Weaviate‚Äôs Verba, with comparison to (the also adapting) existing tools like those from Algolia and Elasticsearch. Broad Criteria My criteria are broad. I‚Äôm focused on concerns my research and training best prepares me to engage with. These are broadly questions related to the explicit and implicit articulation of the search system, the interactions around queries and results, the ability to share the burden of search, and the formalized methods of complaint. I‚Äôll do some explicit evaluations of atomic performance related to ‚Äúhallucination‚Äù or ‚Äúgroundedness‚Äù, but my focus is more on how people perceive and perform-with tool outputs than the outputs themselves. How are the searchers ushered into their searches? What do they see as searchable? How can they engage with search results (or responses)? Are they expected to vet the responses for hallucinations? How is automation bias addressed? What post-search activities are supported by the search system itself? I‚Äôll ask about features or uses that might perhaps be refused or reimagined, while situating this period of search amidst a longer history of search. There are importance concerns about misleading results, sources of training and reference data, oversight, and the future of work. I‚Äôm very much developing these reviews to acknowledge that these systems will keep changing. Where there are very important concerns that I am less well-versed in, like accessibility, I will leverage other resources. What searches can we avoid doing? What newly / more easily think to do? What make newly possible? What can be slower or faster? Seamful? Viscid? Vetted? Doubtful & deliberate? Ephemeral or persistent? Memorable? Public? Shared? Surfing or blazing? Embedded? Loosely coupled? Fun? Daniel Griffin, Sep 3, 2023 Scoping This is not intended to be an introductory guide to these systems, but focused on making sense of what new search tools are providing and what they might become. These reviews may be useful to heavy users, developers, and others looking to understand changes in system support for various searching practices. I will largely be looking at systems for web search, including those more focused to particular subject areas. Though important, these reviews will not (yet at least) engage with new search systems for: academic search: Examples: Consensus (consensus.app) Elicit (elicit.org) See: Michael Gusenbauer‚Äôs call for independent audits (author copy) Aaron Tay‚Äôs ‚Äúcategorization of interesting new academic discovery tools‚Äù enterprise search Examples: Glean (glean.com) Vectara (vectara.com) personal knowledge management Examples: Klu (klu.so) Rewind (rewind.ai) I will not be trying to replicate metrics like that in ragas (tagline: ‚ÄúEvaluation framework for your Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines‚Äù; from Exploding Gradient). Those metrics are intended to examine: Faithfulness, Context Relevancy, Context Recall, Answer Relevancy, Aspect Critiques. I‚Äôm more interested in actions outside the RAG-pipeline itself. What can be done to improve coordination between searcher expectation and system performance? What can be done to remedy system failures at searching-time? I will also not be focused on in-editor code generation tools (like GitHub‚Äôs Copilot) and writing tools (like Lex.page) that replace or subsume some searching tasks. I will not very focused on various metrics related to speed, unless it is very noticeable in frequent use. I am concerned about questions of bias, but here only insofar as these systems are markedly different from the prior problems found in search. I am not focused on explainability or transparency of these systems, though some question will definitely engage with those questions. I will be more focused on examining questions around seamfulness, tractability, and traceability. I will be thinking about how practical algorithmic knowledge [@cotter2022practical] is built up and valued. I‚Äôm less focused on responding to or rehashing and regurgitating arguments about ‚Äúmodel collapse‚Äù, than perhaps looking at how these search tools and their users imagine supporting or working towards unsealing knowledge, whether through articulations that help users doubt & dig deeper, providing multiple drafts, or RAG adaptations. The most important work would be work looking at how these search systems and tools are imagined and used (or not) by other people. I am not looking at that right now, but I will look at aspects of the systems identified publicly by different users or others. Roadmap Add to system pages (background, reference data, reflections); scraping; interviews and guest commentary; glossary; reading list; suggested class exercises and discussion questions; add search functionality. Additional Criteria under Consideration (incomplete) Queries Do they support persistent queries? Does it autocorrect queries? Disclosure of rating and moderation practices. Different practices may cause more or less harm to the individuals tasks in those roles. These practices may also be a leading indicator of the trustworthiness of the system itself. See @meisner2022labor. Explicit statement about responsibility around something like ‚Äòsocietal relevance‚Äô [@sundin2021relevance]? Oversight Is there an oversight or advisory board of any type (outside of legal mandates? Comment: See AI ethics boards, Ethical Use Advisory Council, the Facebook Oversight board, etc., [@magassa2017diverse; @young2019inclusive] Feedback and Complaint Are there formal feedback mechanisms for the search results or conversation pages? What is the transparency around feedback? Are there examples of changes from community feedback? Community Are there sponsored community spaces (forums, workspaces)? Note: Often Discord channels, sometimes Slack Refining, Revising, and Reviewing Results Is there support for disambiguating terms used in questions? Are there clarification prompts? Are there suggested or related searches? Is there ‚Äòfaceted search‚Äô? Are follow-on searches supported in conversational interfaces? Are there branching searches? Can you re-generate the response? Can you adjust ‚Äòtemperature‚Äô? Can you ‚Äòblock results‚Äô? Can you ‚Äòfilter results‚Äô? Can you ‚Äòsort results‚Äô? Safety Are there ‚Äúsafesearch‚Äù options? Are there statements about children using the system? Sharing Is there a way to share search sessions (multiple queries across a time period)? Is there a co-search function (share a link to a shared search session)? Standards, Openness, and Auditing Have they published academic research? Do they provide access to academic researchers or journalists? See, ex. Lurie‚Äôs comparison of platform research API requirements [@lurie2023comparing] Is there an engineering blog? Do they actively support user audits? TODO: pull from /docs/2023/07/05/search-audits.html See also: Feedback and Complaint above. Have there been external evaluations? History Is there a clear and accessible link to search history? Is there a search function in the search history? Disclaimers, Warnings, and Doubting Is there a disclaimer for searches with limited results? Perhaps like Google‚Äôs warning around so-called ‚Äúdata voids‚Äù [@golebiewski2018data; golebiewski2019data] Are there efforts to encourage appropriate ‚Äúdoubting‚Äù [lindemann2023sealed_paper; @lindemann2023sealed_poster] (or unsealing of knowledges)?

How can I achieve this in Godot 4?] [Why are there so many potholes in SF and can I get money if my car is broken by one] [How do I conditionally import components in Astro?] [Compare and contrast H100 availability across Lambda Labs and AWS] Yes Ex. [Check today's weather] [Find cost-effective vacations] [Shop for running shoes] Do default example searches have contextually relevant explanation on sourcing? No No Partial On mobile app there are example searches listed above the search bar, explained only by the word 'Popular' No No Is there a \"searchable repository of examples\"? The phrase \"searchable repository of examples\" comes from Zamfirescu-Pereira et al., 2023. They point to a \"prompt book\" for DALL¬∑E. Other examples, also in the image generation domain, include Lexica (marketing itself as \"The Stable Diffusion search engine\"). See also the searchable LangChain Hub prompt repository for developers. No Partial `# show-and-tell` channel in the Discord channel: 'Show off what you've found with Metaphor!'

(with a weekly challenge for the best question; pinned message show example queries (note these are queries of their Discord bot))**(3)** A [Discover](https://www.perplexity.ai/discover) page shares 30 example queries. Partial `# ü§Øimpressive-results` channel in the Discord channel No `# create-and-share` channel in the Discord channel appears focused on image generation rather than searching with You.com All or YouChat. Sharing searching Support users in sharing their search experience with others. Research demonstrates significant value in users communicating about their experiences with tools. Better support for sharing interactions with these systems may improve users collective ability to effectively question/complain, teach, & organize about/around/against these tools (i.e. \"working around platform errors and limitations\" & \"virtual assembly work\" {% cite burrell2019control %}, \"repairing searching\" {% cite griffin2022situating %}, search quality complaints {% cite griffin2022search %}, and end-user audits {% cite metaxa2021auditing lam2022end %}) and improve our \"practical knowledge\" of the systems {% cite cotter2022practical %}. Can you share a link to the results or conversation? Is there a share interface? For example, this is supported on OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Bard. It is not supported on Anthropic's Claude. No No Yes Yes Yes Requires sign-in. Is there an explanation of how the share interface works provided or linked to in the interface itself? Examples:(1) The share interface in OpenAI's ChatGPT has a \"More Info \" link to their FAQ page: ChatGPT Shared Links FAQ:(2) The share interface in Google's Bard has a \"Learn more\" link to a Bard Help page: Share your Bard chats: N/A N/A Partial The share link interface consists of the button, with a lock and labelled 'Share', and a popup showing the current 'Secret' state and an option to make 'Shareable:Clicking 'Shareable' copies the link and presents options to facilitate sharing directly to Twitter, WhatsApp, and Facebook: No The share link interface consists of the share button icon and a popup: Partial The share link interface consists of the share button icon and a popup which says 'Share YouChat transcript' and 'Anyone with a link will be able to view your full transcript with YouChat in this session.' and presents a link to the search: Do shared links update if the sharee's interaction with the system continues?? Example: Here is the interaction in ChatGPT, per ChatGPT Shared Links FAQ: If I continue the conversation after I create a shared link, will the rest of my conversation appear in the shared link?No. Think of a shared link as a snapshot of a conversation up to the point at which you generate the shared link. N/A N/A (1) Links to searches reproduce the search from the URL.(2) Metaphor does not have follow-on queries/questions. Sometimes (1) It is not explicitly stated, but it appears that further interactions by the sharer on the same 'thread' may break the original link (`error=ThreadAccessNotAllowed` appears in the URL, and there is a temporary popup saying the same; try: example): (2) Perplexity has another way to share as well: Collections. A search shared to a collection and then subsequently expanded is updated for the sharee(s). No It is not explicitly stated, but it appears that further interactions by the sharer on the same chat are NOT updated at the shared link. No It is not explicitly stated, but it appears that further interactions by the sharer on the same chat are NOT updated at the shared link. Is there a social share card? Quality of share cards may influence the engagement on social platforms. No Yes Links to searches produce a social share card. Yes Share interface links produce a social share card. No Yes Share interface links produce a social share card. Are share links (or links to searches) indexed and searchable in search engines (or the system itself)? Permitting share links to be indexed by search engines may allow searchers elsewhere to find and evaluate the quality of the system responses.

Standards & Openness Support interoperability and extensibility. This includes checking if a platform supports searching by URL and if it offers an API.Coming soon: Examine support for the OpenSearch protocol ([mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/OpenSearch) | [GitHub](https://github.com/dewitt/opensearch) | [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSearch)); record comments about open source; record contributions to & integrations from open source. Can you search by URL? Searching by URL has long been a staple approach to searching. This allows people to link to (live) searches (to bookmark or share with others) and to integrate searching within simple scripts. This also supports auditing. No Yes Example: What is an LLM? Yes Example: What is an LLM? Yes Example: What is an LLM? Yes Example: What is an LLM? Is there an API? Searching by API may better support evaluations of the search results and the development of modifications or extensions building on or with the search system. No Yes No No No You.com does not offer an API for search or chat at this time. However, we are considering creating one in the future.

Example: Here is the interaction in ChatGPT, per ChatGPT Shared Links FAQ: If I continue the conversation after I create a shared link, will the rest of my conversation appear in the shared link?No. Think of a shared link as a snapshot of a conversation up to the point at which you generate the shared link. No It is not explicitly stated, but it appears that further interactions by the sharer on the same chat are NOT updated at the shared link. Is there a social share card? Quality of share cards may influence the engagement on social platforms. No Are share links (or links to searches) indexed and searchable in search engines (or the system itself)? Permitting share links to be indexed by search engines may allow searchers elsewhere to find and evaluate the quality of the system responses. Depending on the disclosure in the interface this may pose a privacy risk to users.

Rotate your device to landscape mode for the best experience. Example searches Help users practice new ways of imagining and formulating queries. Research suggests that effective prompting of LLMs can be challenging [@zamfirescu-pereira2023johnny] and query formulation even in mainstream web search engines is complicated [@tripodi2018searching]. @mollick2023useful, not specifically re search systems, has called for ‚Äúlarge-scale public libraries of prompts‚Äù. Are there default example searches? Comment: It may be interesting to also consider whether these queries demonstrate an advantage of the generative search capabilities or not. Yes Ex. [Check today's weather] [Find cost-effective vacations] [Shop for running shoes] Do default example searches have contextually relevant explanation on sourcing? No Is there a \"searchable repository of examples\"? The phrase \"searchable repository of examples\" comes from Zamfirescu-Pereira et al., 2023. They point to a \"prompt book\" for DALL¬∑E.
