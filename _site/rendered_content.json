Search Systems Andi Search Metaphor Perplexity AI Phind You.com Draft edited September 20, 2023 10:11 PM (PDT) See the initial post here. This hosts the provisional comparative evaluation of new web search systems with a focus on dimensions around integrating with users' curiosity-engagement, question-generation, response validation, search repair, search sharing, complaint and feedback, and other concerns at the core of my research. The new attention to search, sparked by widespread interest in OpenAI's ChatGPT, has pushed many to develop new ways to search. This evaluation is a look towards comparing different search systems, with a particular eye towards finding and shining some light on systems that are opening up search in new ways. I have a wide range of criteria by which to provide some marks and remarks on these systems. I'll need to narrow them down and gradually work through them. I'm not thinking about them as goals, requirements, or desired-specifications, and some even may contradict. For some of the criteria I will provide citations as reference or support. Some criteria are drawn from examples in previous search systems (including shuttered, speculative, and experimental systems). My goal here is not to simply do an accounting of searching today, but to get some sense of where we might want search to go. Initial Search Systems In this initial set of reviews, I’m focusing on these search engines, listed alphabetically: Andi Search (andisearch.com) Metaphor (metaphor.systems) Perplexity AI (perplexity.ai) Phind (phind.com) You.com (you.com) These are my initial examples of new approaches to searching in generative web search systems. I may provide come contextualizing comments about other systems, like the explicit search-focused tools from Google and Microsoft, and chat-based systems like ChatGPT, Anthropic’s Claude, etc., that support search and search-like interactions. To they extend that they support public-facing search, I will also be examining newer search libraries and services (including RAG frameworks), like the offerings from LangChain, from LlamaIndex, and Weaviate’s Verba, with comparison to (the also adapting) existing tools like those from Algolia and Elasticsearch. Broad Criteria My criteria are broad. I’m focused on concerns my research and training best prepares me to engage with. These are broadly questions related to the explicit and implicit articulation of the search system, the interactions around queries and results, the ability to share the burden of search, and the formalized methods of complaint. I’ll do some explicit evaluations of atomic performance related to “hallucination” or “groundedness”, but my focus is more on how people perceive and perform-with tool outputs than the outputs themselves. How are the searchers ushered into their searches? What do they see as searchable? How can they engage with search results (or responses)? Are they expected to vet the responses for hallucinations? How is automation bias addressed? What post-search activities are supported by the search system itself? I’ll ask about features or uses that might perhaps be refused or reimagined, while situating this period of search amidst a longer history of search. There are importance concerns about misleading results, sources of training and reference data, oversight, and the future of work. I’m very much developing these reviews to acknowledge that these systems will keep changing. Where there are very important concerns that I am less well-versed in, like accessibility, I will leverage other resources. What searches can we avoid doing? What newly / more easily think to do? What make newly possible? What can be slower or faster? Seamful? Viscid? Vetted? Doubtful & deliberate? Ephemeral or persistent? Memorable? Public? Shared? Surfing or blazing? Embedded? Loosely coupled? Fun? Daniel Griffin, Sep 3, 2023 Scoping This is not intended to be an introductory guide to these systems, but focused on making sense of what new search tools are providing and what they might become. These reviews may be useful to heavy users, developers, and others looking to understand changes in system support for various searching practices. I will largely be looking at systems for web search, including those more focused to particular subject areas. Though important, these reviews will not (yet at least) engage with new search systems for: academic search: Examples: Consensus (consensus.app) Elicit (elicit.org) See: Michael Gusenbauer’s call for independent audits (author copy) Aaron Tay’s “categorization of interesting new academic discovery tools” enterprise search Examples: Glean (glean.com) Vectara (vectara.com) personal knowledge management Examples: Klu (klu.so) Rewind (rewind.ai) I will not be trying to replicate metrics like that in ragas (tagline: “Evaluation framework for your Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines”; from Exploding Gradient). Those metrics are intended to examine: Faithfulness, Context Relevancy, Context Recall, Answer Relevancy, Aspect Critiques. I’m more interested in actions outside the RAG-pipeline itself. What can be done to improve coordination between searcher expectation and system performance? What can be done to remedy system failures at searching-time? I will also not be focused on in-editor code generation tools (like GitHub’s Copilot) and writing tools (like Lex.page) that replace or subsume some searching tasks. I will not very focused on various metrics related to speed, unless it is very noticeable in frequent use. I am concerned about questions of bias, but here only insofar as these systems are markedly different from the prior problems found in search. I am not focused on explainability or transparency of these systems, though some question will definitely engage with those questions. I will be more focused on examining questions around seamfulness, tractability, and traceability. I will be thinking about how practical algorithmic knowledge [@cotter2022practical] is built up and valued. I’m less focused on responding to or rehashing and regurgitating arguments about “model collapse”, than perhaps looking at how these search tools and their users imagine supporting or working towards unsealing knowledge, whether through articulations that help users doubt & dig deeper, providing multiple drafts, or RAG adaptations. The most important work would be work looking at how these search systems and tools are imagined and used (or not) by other people. I am not looking at that right now, but I will look at aspects of the systems identified publicly by different users or others. Roadmap Under Construction This is presently very much under construction, much more a speculative prototype than a full-fledged system. A proper system will require many more people working together. I am not proposing I have the “solution” or could build out a framework like this alone. This is just part of my joining the conversation about what search might be. TODO Add to system pages (background, reference data, reflections); scraping; interviews and guest commentary; glossary; reading list; suggested class exercises and discussion questions; add search functionality. Additional Criteria under Consideration (incomplete) Queries Do they support persistent queries? Does it autocorrect queries? Disclosure of rating and moderation practices. Different practices may cause more or less harm to the individuals tasks in those roles. These practices may also be a leading indicator of the trustworthiness of the system itself. See @meisner2022labor. Explicit statement about responsibility around something like ‘societal relevance’ [@sundin2021relevance]? Oversight Is there an oversight or advisory board of any type (outside of legal mandates? Comment: See AI ethics boards, Ethical Use Advisory Council, the Facebook Oversight board, etc., [@magassa2017diverse; @young2019inclusive] Feedback and Complaint Are there formal feedback mechanisms for the search results or conversation pages? What is the transparency around feedback? Are there examples of changes from community feedback? Community Are there sponsored community spaces (forums, workspaces)? Note: Often Discord channels, sometimes Slack Refining, Revising, and Reviewing Results Is there support for disambiguating terms used in questions? Are there clarification prompts? Are there suggested or related searches? Is there ‘faceted search’? Are follow-on searches supported in conversational interfaces? Are there branching searches? Can you re-generate the response? Can you adjust ‘temperature’? Can you ‘block results’? Can you ‘filter results’? Can you ‘sort results’? Safety Are there “safesearch” options? Are there statements about children using the system? Sharing Is there a way to share search sessions (multiple queries across a time period)? Is there a co-search function (share a link to a shared search session)? Standards, Openness, and Auditing Have they published academic research? Do they provide access to academic researchers or journalists? See, ex. Lurie’s comparison of platform research API requirements [@lurie2023comparing] Is there an engineering blog? Do they actively support user audits? TODO: pull from /docs/2023/07/05/search-audits.html See also: Feedback and Complaint above. Have there been external evaluations? History Is there a clear and accessible link to search history? Is there a search function in the search history? Disclaimers, Warnings, and Doubting Is there a disclaimer for searches with limited results? Perhaps like Google’s warning around so-called “data voids” [@golebiewski2018data; golebiewski2019data] Are there efforts to encourage appropriate “doubting” [lindemann2023sealed_paper; @lindemann2023sealed_poster] (or unsealing of knowledges)? Project This project is not externally funded. Daniel Griffin, Ph.D., is pursuing this work in the course of his research and job search."

Search Systems Andi Search Metaphor Perplexity AI Phind You.com Welcome to SearchRights.org, a platform (under construction) dedicated to the evaluation and promotion of search systems that focus on including the user. We critically evaluate search systems based on a robust, user-centric framework. We examine how search systems (from engines and agents to frameworks and tools) support searcher rights to: Compare: Explore and develop practical knowledge of various search systems for informed decisions. Complain & Contest: Challenge systems when they fall short of user needs or expectations. Repair: Modify or fix search systems without facing unwarranted obstructions. Share: Involve others in searches, teach others about searching, and assemble to improve search. Extend: Adapt systems and practices. Choose: Freely select the search tools that resonate with individual needs, values, and aspirations. Learn: Cultivate curiosity and questions, address ignorance, and search even outside of clear tasks or goals. Our framework emphasizes: Comparative Evaluations: Through rigorous and interdisciplinary methodologies, we provide clear comparisons of how various search systems support or challenge the searcher. Diversity: Our vision embraces the multitude of ways people search, promoting a landscape where different methodologies coexist and evolve. Our commitment at SearchRights.org is clear: to move beyond the status quo and ensure the search landscape prioritizes and truly includes its users. About See the Table See the Log"

Rotate your device to landscape mode for the best experience. Example searches Help users practice new ways of imagining and formulating queries. Research suggests that effective prompting of LLMs can be challenging (Zamfirescu-Pereira et al., 2023) and query formulation even in mainstream web search engines is complicated (Tripodi, 2018). Mollick (2023), not specifically re search systems, has called for “large-scale public libraries of prompts”. Are there default example searches? Comment: It may be interesting to also consider whether these queries demonstrate an advantage of the generative search capabilities or not. Yes Ex.

Do default example searches have contextually relevant explanation on sourcing? No Is there a \"searchable repository of examples\"? The phrase \"searchable repository of examples\" comes from Zamfirescu-Pereira et al., 2023. They point to a \"prompt book\" for DALL·E. Other examples, also in the image generation domain, include Lexica (marketing itself as \"The Stable Diffusion search engine\"). See also the searchable LangChain Hub prompt repository for developers. No Sharing searching Support users in sharing their search experience with others. Research demonstrates significant value in users communicating about their experiences with tools. Better support for sharing interactions with these systems may improve users collective ability to effectively question/complain, teach, & organize about/around/against these tools (i.e. “working around platform errors and limitations” & “virtual assembly work” (Burrell et al., 2019), “repairing searching” (Griffin, 2022), search quality complaints (Griffin & Lurie, 2022), and end-user audits (Metaxa et al., 2021; Lam et al., 2022)) and improve our “practical knowledge” of the systems (Cotter, 2022).

Example: Here is the interaction in ChatGPT, per ChatGPT Shared Links FAQ: If I continue the conversation after I create a shared link, will the rest of my conversation appear in the shared link?No. Think of a shared link as a snapshot of a conversation up to the point at which you generate the shared link. Sometimes (1) It is not explicitly stated, but it appears that further interactions by the sharer on the same 'thread' may break the original link (`error=ThreadAccessNotAllowed` appears in the URL, and there is a temporary popup saying the same; try: example): (2) Perplexity has another way to share as well: Collections. A search shared to a collection and then subsequently expanded is updated for the sharee(s). Is there a social share card? Quality of share cards may influence the engagement on social platforms. Yes Share interface links produce a social share card. Are share links (or links to searches) indexed and searchable in search engines (or the system itself)? Permitting share links to be indexed by search engines may allow searchers elsewhere to find and evaluate the quality of the system responses. Depending on the disclosure in the interface this may pose a privacy risk to users.

Can you search by URL? Searching by URL has long been a staple approach to searching. This allows people to link to (live) searches (to bookmark or share with others) and to integrate searching within simple scripts. This also supports auditing. Yes Example: What is an LLM? Is there an API for search? Searching by API may better support evaluations of the search results and the development of modifications or extensions building on or with the search system.We do not currently evaluate the performance of the API or restrictions on access. You.com, for instance, says this: If you are interested in being an early access partner please email api@you.com with your use case, background, and expected daily load. Other search engines that provide some form of API include the Brave Search API, Google (through their Programmable Search Engine's Custom Search JSON API), Microsoft's Bing Web Search API, and the Yandex Search API.You can also get programmatic or tool-based access to web search results from many third party providers that scrape search results from search engines. For example, academic researchers have conducted research using data from SerpAPI (Zade et al., 2022 ) and Ahrefs (Williams & Carley, 2023). No Perplexity provides an API for interacting with open-source LLMs (see Oct 4, 2023 blogpost: \"Introducing pplx-api\". While not a search API, Perplexity also wrote in the blogpost that it would be providing a \"Perplexity RAG-LLM API with grounding for facts and citations\" in the near future. Does the system provide open-source models? Providing open source models can advance the general search landscape as well as help users better understand the capabilities and limitations of the search system. No Supporting feedback Help users develop, submit, and share feedback. Mechanisms to support feedback will shape user expectations, experiences, and future improvements of the search landscape. Some approaches may excessively conceal or otherwise control complaint rather than focusing on the users. Is there a clear contextually relevant feedback method for core search functionality? This is distinct from having a Contact or Feedback link buried off-page or in a footer. Yes There is a flag (\"Not accurate\") button at the bottom of the response.

Standards & Openness Support interoperability and extensibility. This includes checking if a platform supports searching by URL and if it offers an API.Coming soon: Examine support for the OpenSearch protocol (mdn | GitHub | Wikipedia); record comments about open source; record contributions to & integrations from open source. Can you search by URL? Searching by URL has long been a staple approach to searching. This allows people to link to (live) searches (to bookmark or share with others) and to integrate searching within simple scripts. This also supports auditing. No Yes Example: What is an LLM? Yes Example: What is an LLM? Yes Example: What is an LLM? Yes Example: What is an LLM? Is there an API for search? Searching by API may better support evaluations of the search results and the development of modifications or extensions building on or with the search system.We do not currently evaluate the performance of the API or restrictions on access. You.com, for instance, says this: If you are interested in being an early access partner please email api@you.com with your use case, background, and expected daily load. Other search engines that provide some form of API include the Brave Search API, Google (through their Programmable Search Engine's Custom Search JSON API), Microsoft's Bing Web Search API, and the Yandex Search API.You can also get programmatic or tool-based access to web search results from many third party providers that scrape search results from search engines. For example, academic researchers have conducted research using data from SerpAPI (Zade et al., 2022 ) and Ahrefs (Williams & Carley, 2023). No Yes Metaphor announced beta access to their search API on Apr 21, 2023. It is now generally available at platform.metaphor.systems No Perplexity provides an API for interacting with open-source LLMs (see Oct 4, 2023 blogpost: \"Introducing pplx-api\". While not a search API, Perplexity also wrote in the blogpost that it would be providing a \"Perplexity RAG-LLM API with grounding for facts and citations\" in the near future. No Yes Updated Oct 18, 2023On Oct 18 LangChain announced support for YouRetriever, using a search API from You.com. LangChain shared a guest blog post from You.com (\"You.com x LangChain\") and an interactive notebook. Some documentation is also available on You.com's website (with an example query: [reasons to smile]: Documentation > Using the Search API(Note: \"To use the You.com Search API, you will need an API key. Please reach out via email at api@you.com for more details.\").Previously:You.com does not offer an API for search or chat at this time. However, we are considering creating one in the future. If you would like to be notified when this happens, fill out the form here. source Does the system provide open-source models? Providing open source models can advance the general search landscape as well as help users better understand the capabilities and limitations of the search system. No No No Yes Phind provides three models, built on fine-tuning CodeLlama-34B on their proprietary dataset. Here is the Phind page on Hugging Face. Here is a Phind blogpost from Aug 25, 2023: Beating GPT-4 on HumanEval with a fine-tuned CodeLlama-34B. No Supporting feedback Help users develop, submit, and share feedback. Mechanisms to support feedback will shape user expectations, experiences, and future improvements of the search landscape. Some approaches may excessively conceal or otherwise control complaint rather than focusing on the users. Is there a clear contextually relevant feedback method for core search functionality? This is distinct from having a Contact or Feedback link buried off-page or in a footer. No Clicking 'Contact' on the left sidebar will open a page with links to a Feedback form and Bug Report form and a note that you can initiate them within the interface by typing `/feedback` or `/bug`. No Yes There is a flag (\"Not accurate\") button at the bottom of the response. There is a question mark button (a dropup with options including a Help & FAQ link). The FAQ page has a Feedback link in the footer that sends the user to a survey. Yes There are thumbs up (\"Good answer.\") / down (\"Bad answer.\") buttons at the bottom of the response fields. Yes There are thumbs up (\"This answer is helpful and/or accurate. Provide feedback on this result.\") / down (\"This answer is not helpful, accurate, and/or safe. Provide feedback on this result.\") buttons at the bottom of the response fields. There is a general 'Give feedback' button at the bottom left of the screen (which links to You.com's Canny.io page). Do users receive a copy of feedback? Not yet evaluated Not yet evaluated Not yet evaluated Not yet evaluated Partial Feedback left on You.com's Canny.io page appears to be persistent. Is the feedback record easily shared by the user with a web-accessible link? Not yet evaluated Not yet evaluated Not yet evaluated Not yet evaluated Partial Feedback left on You.com's Canny.io page can be linked to. Can users opt-in to contribute feedback to a commons-based infrastructure? Sharing feedback from users in a transparent and privacy-preserving manner may improve the larger search landscape. Something like commons-based infrastructures, interfaces, or record repositories already exist for other factors, like IndexNow, Lumen, the ClaimReview schema, robots.txt, the OpenSearch protocol, research datasets and benchmarks, etc.These are resources that search systems may contribute to, respect, or draw on.Research shows that search systems already rely heavily on Wikipedia (see especially, McMahon et al. (2017 )).Note: The proximate cause of adding this criteria was the responses from the CEOs of Perplexity AI and You.com to a Oct 15, 2023 comment from Yann LeCun (Chief AI Scientist at Meta):Human feedback for open source LLMs needs to be crowd-sourced, Wikipedia style.It is the only way for LLMs to become the repository of all human knowledge and cultures.Who wants to build the platform for this? No No No In response to the question from Yann LeCun, Aravind Srinivas (Perplexity AI's CEO) said (on Oct 15, 2023): perplexity.ai No No In response to the question from Yann LeCun, Richard Socher (You.com's CEO) said (on Oct 15, 2023): I've been saying similar things for a while. We'd be down to help coordinate at you.com and allow users to opt-in to contribute feedback for specific answers.. Works Cited Burrell, J., Kahn, Z., Jonas, A., & Griffin, D. (2019).
