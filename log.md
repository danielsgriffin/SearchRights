- 2023-09-08 15:08:02 Added to the 'Is there a "searchable repository of examples" [@zamfirescu-pereira2023johnny]?' remark for Perplexity AI:

    > `# ðŸ”Ž â”‚ ask` channel in the Discord channel: "ask \@PerplexityAI anything. Check pinned for usage." (with a weekly challenge for the best question; pinned message show example queries (note these are queries of their Discord bot))

- 2023-09-08 15:09:22 Added to the 'Is there a "searchable repository of examples" [@zamfirescu-pereira2023johnny]?' criteria comment:
    
    > See also [the LangChain Hub prompt repository](/docs/2023/09/08/the-langchain-hub.html) (not searchable).

- 2023-09-08 15:28:00 Added to the 'Example searches' criteria category comment:

    > @mollick2023useful, not specifically re search systems, has called for <a href="/excerpts/2023/09/08/large-scale-public-libraries-of-prompts.html">"large-scale public libraries of prompts"</a>


- 2023-09-08 15:31:06 Added link to the 'Is there a "searchable repository of examples" [@zamfirescu-pereira2023johnny]?' criteria text: to ["A searchable repository of examples..."](/excerpts/2023/09/08/a-searchable-repository-of-examples.html)

- 2023-09-08 15:53:17 Added a paragraph re ragas under Scoping:

    > I will not be trying to replicate metrics like that in [ragas](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas) (tagline: "Evaluation framework for your Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines"; from [Exploding Gradient](https://github.com/explodinggradients)). Those metrics are intended to examine: Faithfulness, Context Relevancy, Context Recall, Answer Relevancy, Aspect Critiques. I'm more interested in actions outside the RAG-pipeline itself. What can be done to improve coordination between searcher expectation and system performance? What can be done to remedy system failures at searching-time?


- 2023-09-08 16:57:49 Added Criteria (incomplete)
- 2023-09-11 16:12:08 Renamed Criteria (incomplete) to Additional Criteria under Consideration (incomplete)
- 2023-09-13 09:15:02 Refactored text, table, and markings. Various smaller edits w/in.
- 2023-09-13 12:06:17 Added example searches for Perplexity AI.

- 2023-09-21 14:03:18 Updated Phind's mark for . I previously had it noted that you had to be signed in to share a search. I do not have documentation of that previous claim. Currently you do not need to be signed in.
- 2023-09-27 11:53:34 Added a 'Sharing searching' criteria: [Are share links (or links to searches) indexed and searchable in search engines (or the system itself)?](/criteria/share-links-indexed-and-searchable.html#table) (and made various UI changes).
