details: "Research demonstrates significant value in users communicating about their experiences with tools. Better support for sharing interactions with these systems may improve users collective ability to effectively question/complain, teach, & organize about/around/against these tools (i.e. \"working around platform errors and limitations\" & \"virtual assembly work\" [@burrell2019control], \"repairing searching\" [@griffin2022situating], search quality complaints [@griffin2022search], and end-user audits [@metaxa2021auditing; @lam2022end]) and improve our \"practical knowledge\" of the systems [@cotter2022practical]."
