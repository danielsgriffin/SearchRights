## Roadmap

### Under Construction

This is presently very much under construction, much more a speculative prototype than a full-fledged system. A proper system will require many more people working together. I am not proposing I have the "solution" or could build out a framework like this alone. **This is just part of my joining the conversation about what search might be.**

### TODO

Add to system pages (background, reference data, reflections); scraping; interviews and guest commentary; glossary; reading list; suggested class exercises and discussion questions; add search functionality.

### Additional Criteria under Consideration (incomplete)
