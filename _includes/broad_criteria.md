My criteria are broad. I'm focused on concerns my research and training best prepares me to engage with. These are broadly questions related to the explicit and implicit articulation of the search system, the interactions around queries and results, the ability to share the burden of search, and the formalized methods of complaint. I'll do some explicit evaluations of atomic performance related to "hallucination" or "groundedness", but my focus is more on [how people perceive and perform-with tool outputs than the outputs themselves](/2023/08/21/people-perceive-and-perform.html). How are the searchers ushered into their searches? What do they see as searchable? How can they engage with search results (or responses)? Are they expected to vet the responses for hallucinations? How is automation bias addressed? What post-search activities are supported by the search system itself?

I'll ask about features or uses that might perhaps be refused or reimagined, while situating this period of search amidst a longer history of search. There are importance concerns about misleading results, sources of training and reference data, oversight, and the future of work. I'm very much developing these reviews to acknowledge that these systems will keep changing. Where there are very important concerns that I am less well-versed in, like accessibility, I will leverage other resources.
