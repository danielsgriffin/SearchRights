In this initial set of reviews, I'm focusing on these search engines, listed alphabetically:

<ul>
<li>Andi Search (<a href="https://andisearch.com/">andisearch.com</a>)</li>
<li>Metaphor (<a href="https://metaphor.systems/">metaphor.systems</a>)</li>
<li>Perplexity AI (<a href="https://www.perplexity.ai/">perplexity.ai</a>)</li>
<li>Phind (<a href="https://www.phind.com/">phind.com</a>)</li>
<li>You.com (<a href="https://you.com/">you.com</a>)</li>
</ul>

These are my initial examples of new approaches to searching in generative web search systems. I may provide come contextualizing comments about other systems, like the explicit search-focused tools from Google and Microsoft, and chat-based systems like ChatGPT, Anthropic's Claude, etc., that support search and search-like interactions.

To they extend that they support public-facing search, I will also be examining newer search libraries and services (including RAG frameworks), like the offerings from LangChain, from LlamaIndex, and [Weaviate's Verba](https://verba.weaviate.io/), with comparison to (the also adapting) existing tools like those from Algolia and Elasticsearch.
