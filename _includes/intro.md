<p class="m-0 p-2">This hosts the provisional comparative evaluation of new web search systems with a focus on dimensions around integrating with users' curiosity-engagement, question-generation, response validation, search repair, search sharing, complaint and feedback, and other concerns at the core of my research.</p>
<p class="m-0 p-2">The new attention to search, sparked by widespread interest in OpenAI's ChatGPT, has pushed many to develop new ways to search.</p>
<p class="m-0 p-2">This evaluation is a look towards comparing different search systems, with a particular eye towards finding and shining some light on systems that are opening up search in new ways.</p>

<p class="m-0 p-2">I have a wide range of criteria by which to provide some marks and remarks on these systems. I'll need to narrow them down and gradually work through them. I'm not thinking about them as goals, requirements, or desired-specifications, and some even may contradict. For some of the criteria I will provide citations as reference or support. Some criteria are drawn from examples in previous search systems (including shuttered, speculative, and experimental systems). My goal here is not to simply do an accounting of searching today, but to get some sense of where we might want search to go.</p>
